            <h1>Musical Theatre</h1><br><p>The heart of our studio is our musical theatre program. If your child has Broadway on the brain and wants to do it all-- singing, dancing, drama--then our Musical Theatre classes are just the ticket.  Our school-year semester MT classes (Fall and Spring) produce Youth Editions of Broadway shows, edited for content, length, and vocal performance levels. Summer Musicals may include full Broadway productions with audition-only casts. No experience is necessary and vocals and choreography for each class are tailored to age and skill levels. Past musicals at Seedling have included Peter Pan, Into the Woods, The Little Mermaid, Seussical, The Lion King, Shrek, Matilda, Little Women, and many more.<br><h1>Acting</h1><br><p>For those wishing to focus more on the dramatic facet of their performance skill set, our straight acting classes expand young performers' knowledge of stagecraft and provide opportunities for practical application through games and activities in addition to weekly rehearsals for that semester's chosen play or short scene collection.  Courses are offered for Jrs. (ages 7-10) and Teens (ages 11-18) and include  exploration of basic stage acting skills, theatre terminology & etiquette, vocal inflection and projection, movement and facial expression, incorporating a variety of techniques and acting methods. But don't let all the theatre jargon fool you--these are super fun classes :)</p>

            <h1>Vocal Performance</h1><br><p>Seedling consistently draws and develops incredibly talented youth vocalists from around the Vegas valley, thanks in most part to our amazing singing coach, Britni Favero. Her dedication to continual education in her field and a love for teaching has inspired vocalists across the country through her private lessons at Seedling and online. Group vocal performance classes and camps are also available year-round for both beginners and advanced students, with an emphasis on solo performance. Technical skills are taught alongside stage presence to create unforgettable recitals and personal improvement in Musical Theatre class performances. Confidence is built by students performing weekly in class for their peers who provide positive feedback and support.</p><br><h1>Summer Camps</h1><br><p>It is not unusual to hear kids declare their desire to spend the whole summer at Seedling. During the months of June and July, there is a whole lot of mess, noise, music, creativity, and laughter going on at Seedling as we take advantage of an all-day theater experience. Unique week-long camps are designed to fit into your busy summer travel and activities and have included full-length musicals, plays, costume and set design, movie making, camps for Sprouts ages 4-6, Shakespeare, teen game nights. and much more. Every summer provides new opportunities to draw in the community with lots of inexpensive entertainment each weekend as our campers pump out shows that are always open to the public.</p>
